Using Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib to do mathematical operations,data manipulation,data visualization:
ADVANTAGES  AND BENIFITS OF USING NUMPY,PANDAS AND MATPLOTLIB IN DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION:
PANDAS:
Pandas library works well for numeric, alphabets, and heterogeneous types of data simultaneously.
If the number of rows of the dataset is more than five hundred thousand (500K), then the performance of Pandas is better than NumPy. 
Pandas consume more memory compared to NumPy.
Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in both floating point and non-floating point data.
Data set merging and joining, reshaping and pivoting of data sets.
some data manipulations are done using pandas like filtering,sorting,grouping,accessing values,finding missing values etc.
NUMPY:
Numpy library works better with only numerical data, has efficient storage, and fastly performs mathematical operations on array-based and array-based matrix-based numeric values.
NumPy can be said to be faster in performance than Pandas, up to fifty thousand (50K) rows and less of the dataset.
NumPy has lesser memory consumption compared to Pandas.
Instacart, SendGrid, Walmart, Tokopedia, and many more organizations make use of NumPy.
Using numpy some mathematical operations are performed in this repository like addition,subtraction.,multiplication,division,modulus,square,cube etc.
MATPLOTLIB:
Matplotlib provides a simple way to access large amounts of data.
It is flexible and supports various forms of data representation.
It is easy to navigate.
It ensures accessibility by providing high-quality images.
It is useful in creating advanced visualizations.
It can run on different platforms.
It makes data analysis easier.
Plots like bar,line,pic charts are plotted by using matplotlib in this bar graph is plotted for age of a patient and BMI.
